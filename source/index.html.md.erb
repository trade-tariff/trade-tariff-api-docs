# GOV.UK Trade Tariff API

The GOV.UK Trade Tariff API makes it easy to access Trade Tariff data
from [https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff](https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff).
The data includes commodity codes, duty and VAT rates.

It is accessed via [HTTPS][] and returns data in a [JSON][]
format. The [reference documentation](reference.html) provides a thorough
overview of the endpoints and the response format.

The OTT team maintains a status page that indicates the overall health of various
services including the backend and FPO applications.

This can be reviewed [here][status]

For internal documentation on the management of the API, please see the [internal documentation][tech-docs].

## What you can do with this API

The data provided by this API is used on [GOV.UK Trade Tariff](https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff).

With the Trade Tariff API, you can access Commodity codes, which [classify
goods](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports)
for import and export. Commodity codes allow you to:

- fill in declarations and other paperwork
- check if there’s duty or VAT to pay
- find out about duty reliefs and preferential rates
- find out if import or export licenses are needed
- Search by free-form text or `goods_nomenclature_item_id`
- Scope some API calls by date, i.e. `/api/v2/goods_nomenclatures/*`
- Provide resources for all headings and all commodities
- Search for quota measures with criteria, including goods nomenclature, year, geographic area, etc.

This API is useful for applications that incorporate content from [GOV.UK Trade Tariff](https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff) and for keeping that content up to date. It is meant to provide a predictable and stable interface to Trade Tariff data.

The API documentation is built from an [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) specification [file](/v2/openapi.yaml) for the Trade Tariff API. This file describes the API and provides example requests and responses.

## Quick start

You can use GOV.UK Tariff API to lookup the data that is used on
[`https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff`](https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff).

To get started:

 1. Using a tool such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/),
    [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or your web browser, make a GET
    request to [`https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/api/v2/sections`](https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/api/v2/sections).
 2. You’ll receive a JSON response and the fields for this are
    explained in the [reference documentation](reference.html).

For example, using the curl command line utility tool:

```shell
curl https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/api/v2/sections
```

## Authentication

Usage of GOV.UK Trade Tariff API does not require authentication.

## User agent identification

Please identify your application in the User-Agent request header using the following format:

`User-Agent: <product> / <product-version> <comment>`

In line with the above example using curl, the User-Agent header can be set with the `--user-agent` switch:

```shell
curl --user-agent 'product / product-version' https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/api/v2/sections
```

Or as a header by passing the `-H` switch:

```shell
curl -H 'User-Agent: product / product-version' https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/api/v2/sections
```

While this is not currently enforced, we reserve the right to enforce this requirement at a later date.
