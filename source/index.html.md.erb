# About

## GOV.UK Trade Tariff API

The GOV.UK Trade Tariff APIs make it easy to access the [UK Trade Tariff Service data](https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff). The data includes commodity codes, duties and VAT rates.

The APIs are useful for any business and individuals wanting to access up-to-date tariff data through a predictable and stable interface.

## What can you do with the APIs?

Using the Trade Tariff APIs, you can search for commodities by:

- name
- code
- date or data range, including historical data

This allows you to fill in declarations and other paperwork and determine:

- if duty or VAT applies
- if duty relief and preferential rates are available
- if import or export licenses are required

You will also be able to:

- search the tariff by date or date range, including historical data
- query quota measures by commodity, year, geographic area and more.

## Using the APIs

There are multiple APIs available through the UK Trade Tariff Service covering different user needs and search criteria. Some of the core APIs are:

- The Commodities API provides detailed UK Trade Tariff data for imports and exports. It is ideal if you want to access structured trade tariff data across jurisdictions and time.
- The Categorisation API relates to bringing goods in and out of Northern Ireland and determines whether goods qualify for the simplified procedures under the Windsor Framework.
- The Fast Parcel Operator (FPO) Commodity Code Identification Tool API is for express operators handling time-dependent deliveries.

Additional APIs are available to support specific trade tariff and classification needs.
