    The Trade Tariff Public API provides a simple and consistent way to request
    [UK Trade Tariff](https://gov.uk/trade-tariff) content as structured data in a predictable format.

    From January 1st 2021, the API will also provide data on the EU Tariff as applies to certain
    trades with Northern Ireland (known as the XI Tariff).

    This API accepts HTTP requests and responds with
    [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) data containing the same
    published content as is presented on GOV.UK.
