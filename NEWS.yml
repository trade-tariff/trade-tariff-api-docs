    ## Version 1 API retirement

    On 31 December 2023, the version 1 APIs for the Online Trade Tariff will be retired.

    Any third party tools using version 1 APIs should be altered to use version 2 APIs instead.

    ## Why are we retiring version 1 APIs?

    The version 1 APIs have not been updated for more than three years, and are therefore quite out of date. Documentation was withdrawn in 2021 to help to ease the path towards this eventual retirement.

    New functionality which has been incorporated into version 2 of the APIs has been omitted from the older version.

    At the same time, supporting version 1 APIs is time-consuming and detracts from the Tariff team's ability to develop and support new features.

    Your application is using the version 1 APIs if the URLs that you are calling feature the term `/uk/api/v1`.

    ## Getting in contact

    If the retirement of the version 1 APIs causes you any issues, please get in contact with us via the email address [hmrc-trade-tariff-support-g@digital.hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:hmrc-trade-tariff-support-g@digital.hmrc.gov.uk).

  title: New measure condition permutations nodes in the commodities API
  content: |
    The commodities API has been updated with a new set of nodes to more consistently explain
    how to interpret the measure conditions on _complex measures_ (where identical conditions exist
    more than once on the same measure with different measure condition codes).

    The rules regarding measure conditions for all *Taric-based* systems are:

    - Where multiple measure conditions exist within the same measure condition code grouping, then the trader must meet one of the 'positive' conditions (OR relationship).
    - Where multiple measure condition groups exist, then the trader must comply with one from each group (AND relationship).

    When a condition (document, waiver or threshold) appears in two condition code groups, this indicates that complex Boolean logic is to be observed as the border system (CDS) works out how to treat the measure conditions.

    This is expressed in the *commodities* API via the use of two new data entities, which are referenced by each measure that has conditions:

    - [measure_condition_permutation_group](/reference.html#measureconditionpermutationgroup)
    - [measure_condition_permutation](/reference.html#measureconditionpermutation)
